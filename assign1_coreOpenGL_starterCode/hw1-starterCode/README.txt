Key Mapping:

1 -> POINTS mode
2 -> WIREFRAME mode 
3 -> TRIANGLES mode 
4 -> SMOOTH mode

't' -> TRANSLATE
'r' -> ROTATE
's' -> SCALE

The project was developed on macOS Big Sur running on an M1 chip (I am not sure how to run this on Windows so I did not test it)

The program will start with a small animation of 300 frames and then you can play around the features.

Check basic.vertexShader.glsl for smooth mode shader program 

Extra Credit: 

1. Used Element Buffers and GlDrawElements to draw all the modes.
